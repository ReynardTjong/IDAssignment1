## Project Name & Design Process

This is my ID Assignment 1. My project name for this assignment is called BLAƆK PIИK REVOLUTION. My project is considered a student HTML project and I will be making a website about Kpop Blackpink group to promote them and with this website and its information inside, people can understand and know they are. This project is targeted to everyone, especially for those who are new and want to understand Blackpink and its members better. It has a decent amount of functionalities that includes HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have a wireframe file here which can be downloaded. This helps to explain what the website might/will look like including the explanations of what the features are:("D:\ID\ID_S10245153_ReynardTjong_Assg01\ID_S10245153_ReynardTjong_Assg1_wireframe.xd").

## Name of contributors

My collaborator for this assignment is my tutor, Mr Donovan Koh.

## Features and potential bugs

Home page: This page is the main page which gives the name of the group and usually their up to date news which currently their new songs and it will have a feature for you to give a listen to it immediately on that page. It will also have a link to guide you to more platforms to download and listen.

About page: This page is about understand blackpink group and its member better. I have made a slider feature (5 in total) to represent each of them respectively. Each of them also has a link to go to a website full of informations if you want to read more about them.

Music page: This page is about their music and albums. Although the page only has the general informations of how many tracks and albums they have made throughout their career. There is a link which will guide you to a Youtube platform where they have made all playlists of their songs and albums.

Shop page: This page is about their products and merchandise. This page is about showcasing their latest updates of merchandise and will give a brief description of their sales offer as well. It will contain link which will guide you to a shopping website where it will sell all complete Blackpink products.

Navigation bar: My navigation bar will have a feature in which you click between the 'Home', 'About', 'Music' and 'Shop' page and it will go to that page respectively. It also has a hover underline effect. The 'BLAƆK PIИK' logo on the top left will also have a hover effect too.

Social media: Their social media links are attached on the platform logo on the middle right of all the pages if you want to follow them. It also has a hover effect too.

Playbutton and pausebutton: A testing button in which you can listen to their latest songs in the home page with the help of javascript.

Responsive: In the mobile version the navigation button became a BP circular button and when you press it, it will show a small rectangular navigation bar to click on its respective page.

Bugs: I would say the only bugs I spot were during the responsive effect when it is in the mobile version mainly during the about page where the sliding effect button padding moved downward a bit due to the excessive long explanations of the members. The other one (desktop version) is in the home page which is when I tried messed with the position of the images, it will mess everything up.

## Technologies Used

In order for me to build my websites I used a lot of tools which helped me to make it possible:

1. CSS clip-path maker: https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/
   Clip-path maker helped me to make the sliding background effect for my about page.

2. Image resizer: https://imageresizer.com/
   Image resizer helped to resize my pictures so that my icons and images needed for the website are perfect enough to fit and won't have much trouble during the padding's and margin's code of CSS.

3. Image background remover: https://photoscissors.com/
   Image background remover helped to remove any unnecessary background colors or wordings as it might not fit with the website theme.

4. Youtube videos to mp4: https://snapsave.io/en4/youtube-mp4
   This is one of the most useful tool to help convert youtube video files or links to mp4 file.

5. HTML, CSS and Javascript code references and examples: https://www.w3schools.com/
   This is arguably the most helpful tool that helped me guide throughout the assignment especially in the case of styling and animating it. How to place the pictures, effects, which placements needed and more.

6. Youtube: Asides from the code references website, I do also look up Youtube to look for inspirations of other people design their websites.
